# Usage

*For more examples, please refer to the tests folder.*

- ## **HashpipeUtils.jl**

    Contains various code to perform computations such as calculating fft of data files, calculating power. Also contains a function to attach to a data buffer and create a vector of arrays that holds data from each data block.

    To begin tracking a data buffer run

        HashpipeUtils.track_databuffer((inst, nbuff, nblocks), 
                                       (np, nt, nc))

    where "inst" is the instance, nbuff is the number of the data buffer, nblocks is the total number of data blocks in the buffer (or the number you want read in, starting from the 0th block). The second input specifies the shape of the arrays stored in the data buffer where np is the number of polarizations, nt is the number of time steps, and nc is the number of coarse channels.

    To compute the FFT for a raw data file, run

        HashpipeUtils.hashpipe_fft(raw_data, nf, chan, np, nt, nc, integrated)

    raw_data must be of type Array{Complex{Int8}, 3} where size(raw_data) == (np, nt, nc). nf is the number of fine channels per coarse channel (must be specified such that nt is an integer multiple of nf). chan is the coarse channel(s) for which to compute the FFT. chan can be specified as a range (ie 3:6). integrated is a boolean value, automatically set to true. If false, will return an array of shape (2, nf, nt√∑nf, nchans), otherwise will sum spectra together spectra along each coarse channel and return an array of shape (np, nchans * nf).

    Other functions include compute_pwr(), which calculates the avg power for each channel in a raw data array.

- ## **StatusBuff.jl**
    Will likely be merged into HashpipeUtils.jl at some point. This module contains functions that track the status buffer and access various fields within it.

    To retreive the value of a field in the Status Buffer, run

        st = Hashpipe.status_t(0,0,0,0)
        StatusBuff.getStatus(st, "FIELD", inst, Type)

    where "FIELD" is replaced with the label of a field in the status buffer and Type is the data type of the value stored at that field (Int, Float, String).

    This module also contains a specific function for accessing the "NULBLKIN" field in the status buffer which can be run with

        StatusBuff.getnblkin(st)
    
- ## **DataBuffFFT.jl**
    This module contains a single function that continuously loops through the data blocks in a data buffer, stores the result of computing the FFT on each block in a circular array, and continuously displays the integrated spectra for the blocks stored in the circular array. To run:

        datablocks = HashpipeCalculations.track_databuffer((inst, nbuff, nblocks), (np, nt, nc))
        circarr = CircularArrayBuffer{Array{Float32, 2}}(n) #n is the number of blocks to be stored
        st = Hashpipe.status_t(0,0,0,0)

        DataBuffFFT.FFTread(datablocks, circarr, chan, st, inst = 0,
                            nf = 2^16, nblocks = 24,t = 1)
